## Conclusion

**Answer to Original Question**: *"Can you determine the audiences they targeted vs. what they got?"*

### YES - Here's What We Found:

**Targeted (Likely)**:
- Ages 25-54, all genders, golf + entertainment interests

**Actually Got**:
- 64% went to 25-54 (✅ on target)
- 36% went to 18-24 and 55+ (⚠️ off target but not bad)
- 72% male, 28% female (⚠️ female underserved)

**Key Insight**:
**Females are 60% more engaged (1.51% vs 0.94% CTR) but getting 72% fewer impressions than males.** This is the #1 optimization opportunity.

**Immediate ROI Opportunity**:
Shift 20% of budget from 35-44 males (0.71% CTR) to 25-34 females (2.12% CTR) = **3x CTR improvement on that spend**.
