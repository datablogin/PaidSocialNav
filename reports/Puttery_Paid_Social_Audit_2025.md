## Key Issues & Recommendations

### 🔴 CRITICAL: Campaign Inactivity (Priority 1)

**Issue:** No ad delivery since May 12, 2025 (6+ months ago as of report date).

**Business Impact:**
- Zero new customer acquisition through paid social
- Loss of brand visibility and competitive positioning
- Wasted account optimization history (Meta algorithm reset after extended pause)
- Competitor ad dominance in Puttery's target markets

**Root Cause Analysis:**
Looking at the data pattern, the sharp May decline ($380 vs. $1,108 in April) suggests either:
1. Intentional campaign pause/budget exhaustion
2. Account-level issue (billing, policy, access)
3. Strategic business decision (seasonal closure, budget reallocation)

**Recommended Actions:**
1. **Immediate (This Week):**
   - Verify Meta Ads account status and billing
   - Check for policy violations or account restrictions
   - Confirm business authorization for ad spend resumption

2. **Short-Term (Next 30 Days):**
   - Reactivate top-performing campaign (ID: 120216654363600515) with $500 test budget
   - Monitor for 7 days to confirm pixel/conversion tracking still functional
   - Scale to $1,500/month if performance matches historical 3.01% CTR

3. **Long-Term (Next Quarter):**
   - Establish automated daily data sync to prevent future monitoring gaps
   - Set up budget pacing alerts to flag 50%+ month-over-month declines

---

### 🔴 CRITICAL: Budget Concentration Risk (Priority 2)

**Issue:** Top 2 campaigns account for 100% of spend in Q1 and Q2 2025.

**Why This Matters:**
- **Single Point of Failure:** If one campaign gets disapproved or hits learning phase issues, 50% of traffic vanishes
- **Limited Audience Testing:** Not exploring new audience segments or creative approaches
- **Inefficient Budget Allocation:** Some campaigns (e.g., #120214304359560515) showed 7461% conversion rates but got minimal ongoing budget

**Data Evidence:**
- November 2024: 8 active campaigns, healthy distribution
- February-May 2025: Only 2 campaigns (consolidation too aggressive)
- Top 3 campaigns = 53% of total historical spend (within acceptable range)
- But Q1/Q2 top 3 = 100% (extreme concentration)

**Recommended Actions:**
1. **Reactivate Campaign Diversity:**
   - Launch 3 new campaigns targeting different objectives:
     - Campaign A: Website visits (CTR optimization)
     - Campaign B: Lead generation (conversion optimization)
     - Campaign C: Brand awareness (reach optimization)

2. **Budget Allocation Framework:**
   - Allocate max 40% of monthly budget to any single campaign
   - Reserve 20% for testing new campaigns/audiences
   - Maintain minimum 4 active campaigns for risk distribution

3. **Historical Campaign Analysis:**
   - Review November 2024 campaigns (5 were discontinued after short runs)
   - Identify why campaigns like #120214520257120515 (3.01% CTR, only 4 days) were stopped
   - Test reactivating top performers from Nov-Dec cohort

---

### 🟡 MEDIUM: Creative Diversity Gap (Priority 3)

**Issue:** No creative metadata available to analyze video vs. image ad performance.

**Current State:**
- All data is aggregated at campaign level
- Cannot determine if conversions are driven by video or static image ads
- Creative diversity rule scores 80/100 (mild penalty for missing data)

**Industry Best Practices:**
- Video ads: 20-40% of social media creative mix (higher engagement)
- Image ads: 60-80% of mix (broader reach, lower production cost)
- Testing both formats maximizes audience coverage

**Recommended Actions:**
1. **Enable Ad-Level Reporting:**
   - Update data sync to pull ad-level insights (currently campaign-level only)
   - Populate `dim_ad` table with creative type metadata
   - Command: `psn meta sync-insights --account-id act_229793224304371 --level ad`

2. **Creative Audit (Manual Review):**
   - Review Meta Ads Manager to identify video vs. image ad distribution
   - Document top-performing creative formats
   - Note: Top campaign (#120216654363600515) has 3.01% CTR - likely video

3. **Creative Testing Framework:**
   - Establish 70/30 split test: 70% proven creative, 30% new formats
   - Test video ads (15-30 seconds) vs. carousel vs. single image
   - Measure CTR lift from video (expect 2-3x vs. static)

---

### 🟡 MEDIUM: Conversion Tracking Validation (Priority 4)

**Issue:** Conversion rates of 237-7461% suggest all user actions are being counted as conversions.

**Why This Is Important:**
- Cost per conversion ($0.04) is suspiciously low vs. industry norm ($2-10)
- May indicate pixel is firing on page views, not actual purchases/leads
- Inflates performance metrics and masks true customer acquisition cost

**Technical Assessment:**
Looking at the data:
- Campaign #120214150916090515: 37,527% conversion rate (130 clicks → 48,785 conversions)
- This means ~375 conversions per click (impossible for traditional conversion events)
- Likely explanation: Pixel firing on multiple page events (page view, scroll depth, time on site)

**Recommended Actions:**
1. **Audit Meta Pixel Configuration:**
   - Review Events Manager to see which events count as "conversions"
   - Separate into:
     - **Standard Events:** Purchase, Lead, CompleteRegistration (true conversions)
     - **Custom Events:** PageView, ViewContent (engagement metrics)

2. **Reconfigure Conversion Optimization:**
   - Set campaigns to optimize for "Purchase" or "Lead" events only
   - Move micro-conversions (page views) to engagement campaigns
   - Expected result: Conversion rate drops to 2-10%, cost per conversion rises to $1-5

3. **Implement Conversion Value Tracking:**
   - Add revenue values to Purchase events
   - Track ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) not just conversion volume
   - This will provide true ROI picture for business decisions

### 🟢 STRENGTH: CTR Performance (Maintain)

**Finding:** Active campaigns achieve 1.29-1.73% CTR in Q1-Q2 2025.

**Why This Matters:**
- Industry benchmark: 1-2% for social media ads
- Puttery consistently hits or exceeds this target
- Indicates strong ad creative and audience targeting

**Top Performers:**
- Campaign #120216654363600515: 3.01% CTR (150% above benchmark)
- Campaign #120214520257120515: 3.01% CTR (early test, 4 days only)
- Campaign #120214553290520515: 3.28% CTR (early test, 3 days only)

**Recommendations to Maintain:**
- Document creative elements from 3.01-3.28% CTR campaigns
- Replicate winning ad formats (likely video + strong CTA)
- Avoid over-rotation to high-impression, low-CTR campaigns (e.g., #120216647185900515 at 0.10%)

---

### 🟢 STRENGTH: No Ad Fatigue (Maintain)

**Finding:** Frequency = 0.0 across all time periods.

**Why This Matters:**
- Ad fatigue occurs when users see same ad 3+ times (frequency > 2.5)
- Leads to declining CTR and rising CPM
- Puttery's zero frequency indicates fresh audience reach

**Analysis:**
- Either tracking limitation (frequency not captured in campaign-level data)
- Or healthy audience pool rotation preventing repeat exposures
- Given only 2 active campaigns in Q1/Q2, likely the former

**Recommendations:**
- Enable frequency reporting in ad-level data pull
- Monitor for frequency creep as campaigns scale
- Implement frequency cap (max 3 impressions per user per 7 days)

---

## Strategic Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Next 30 Days)

1. **Reactivate Account** - Resolve 6-month pause, restart top campaign
2. **Verify Tracking** - Audit Meta Pixel to ensure accurate conversion attribution
3. **Launch Campaign #4** - Add third campaign to reduce concentration risk

**Success Metrics:**
- Campaign reactivated and serving ads within 7 days

- Budget concentration <70% by end of month

### Short-Term Initiatives (Next Quarter)

1. **Diversify Campaign Portfolio**
   - Target: 5 active campaigns across different objectives
   - Budget split: 40% best performer, 40% proven performers, 20% tests

2. **Implement Creative Rotation**
   - Pull ad-level data to identify video vs. image performance
   - Test 3 new video creatives (15-30 seconds)
   - A/B test carousel ads vs. single image

3. **Enhance Reporting**
   - Set up automated daily BigQuery syncs
   - Build monthly performance dashboard
   - Track ROAS, not just conversion volume

**Success Metrics:**

   - Allocate 40% of annual budget to peak months
   - Maintain minimum "always-on" campaigns during off-peak

2. **Multi-Platform Expansion**
   - Meta represents one platform; consider TikTok (golf content performs well)
   - Test Google Display for retargeting
   - Explore Pinterest for venue/event promotion

3. **Advanced Optimization**
   - Implement Dynamic Creative Optimization (DCO) for automated testing
   - Use Advantage+ shopping campaigns if e-commerce component exists
